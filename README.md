#  Automated Charity Donations

##  Project Description
**Automated Charity Donations** is a Solidity-based smart contract that enables transparent and automatic distribution of Ether donations to a set of pre-approved charities. The system is managed by an owner who can add or remove charities. When a user donates, the contract splits the donation equally among all currently approved charities and transfers the funds directly to them, ensuring trust and eliminating intermediaries.

##  Features
- **Owner-Managed Charities**  
  Only the contract owner can add or deactivate charities.

- **Equal Donation Distribution**  
  Donations are automatically and equally divided among all currently approved charities.

- **Transparent Ledger**  
  Tracks the total amount donated and individual contributions.

- **Charity Metadata Access**  
  Anyone can view information about each listed charity, including name, address, and status.

- **Failsafe Control**  
  Charities can be deactivated without deleting data, preserving transparency.
